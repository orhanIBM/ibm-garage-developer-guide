These have been designed to give you a production ready\nentry point for cloud native development.

These patterns are\nnot optimised for production usage and do not include a number of key IBM Garage best practices.

They all have most of the\nfeatures listed below. They must be UBI ([Universal Base Image](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image)) based\nso they can run in Red Hat OpenShift as well as Kubernetes. They must have a `Dockerfile` that uses that UBI.\nTo make them work with continuous integration, you can provide a Jenkins or Tekton pipeline.\n\nMake sure there is a good use case that is repeatable in your solution architecture. Make sure the code is documented and includes a `README.md'.
