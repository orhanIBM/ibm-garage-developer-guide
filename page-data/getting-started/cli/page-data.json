Its key objective is to make complicated CLI tasks and `YAML`,`configMap` and `secret` configuration easier for a developer.\n\nThese utilities include:\n- Register your application's git repo into a CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration), [Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton), etc.)\n- List the ingress URLs for the tools installed in the environment\n- List the user names and passwords for the tools installed in the environment\n- Build and deploy images to the environment using the IBM Cloud Image Registry\n- Help copy `configMaps` and `secrets` into new projects/namespace in Kubernetes or OpenShift\n\nTo use the IGC CLI, it must be installed and your terminal and you are logged into IBM Cloud with the IBM Cloud CLI.\n\n## Installation\n\nFollow these steps to use the IGC CLI:\n- Install the CLI:\n    ```bash\n    npm i -g @garage-catalyst/ibm-garage-cloud-cli\n    ````\n- Run the CLI's help command to list the available commands:\n    ```bash\n    igc --help\n    ```\n\n    The help output looks like this:\n\n    ```bash\n    % igc --help\n    IBM Garage Cloud CLI\n\n    Usage: igc <command> [args]\n\n    Commands:\n      igc jenkins-auth           Generate a Jenkins api token and register it as\n                                 kubernetes secret\n      igc gen-token              Generate a Jenkins api token\n      igc pipeline               Register a pipeline for the current code repository\n                                 in Jenkins                      [aliases: register]\n      igc git-webhook            Create a git webhook for a given Jenkins pipeline\n      igc dashboard              Open the dashboard url in the default browser\n      igc build                  Build the image and push it into the IBM Cloud\n                                 registry\n      igc deploy                 Deploy an image from the IBM Cloud registry into a\n                                 kubernetes cluster\n      igc tools                  Launch the IBM Garage for Cloud tools image\n                                 connected to the current directory\n      igc vlan                   Print out the vlan values\n      igc credentials            Lists the urls and credentials for the tools\n                                 deployed to the cluster\n      igc ingress                List the current ingress hosts for deployed apps in\n                                 a namespace\n      igc tool-config            Create the config map and secret for a tool\n                                 configured in the environment\n      igc namespace <namespace>  Create a namespace (if it doesn't exist) and\n                                 prepare it with the necessary configuration\n\n    Options:\n      --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]\n      --help     Show help\n    ```\n\n## Use the CLI\n\nTo use the IGC CLI you must be logged into your\nIBM Cloud account using the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli \"IBM Cloud CLI and Developer Tools\").\n\n- Log into your IBM Cloud account with the correct region and resource group:\n    ```bash\n    ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region> -g <resource group>\n    ```\n\n- Once logged in, you can use the CLI commands.\n\n    For example, this command lists the dashboard ingress URLs for all of the install tools in the tools namespace:\n\n    ```bash\n    igc ingress -n tools\n    ```\n\n## Available commands\n\n### vlan\n\nLists the `vlans` for a particular `resource group` and `region`. The command\nexpects that an `ibmcloud login` has already been performed to set up the\nenvironment. This information is useful for preparing Terraform cluster creation steps\n\n### credentials\n\nPrints the urls and credentials for the tools deployed into the cluster.\nThis includes Jenkins, Argo CD, and SonarQube, Pact, Artifactory.\n\n### ingress\n\nLists the ingress urls for the provided namespace. If no namespace\nis provided, `dev` is used.\n\n### pipeline\n\nRegisters a git repository project as a Jenkins pipeline by creating a Kubernetes secret to hold\nthe Git authentication information, calling the Jenkins API, and creating a web-hook.\nThis command is intended to be run within the repository directory of a project for\nwhich a pipeline should be generated. You can supply a new namespace for your pipeline\n\n```\nigc pipeline -n team-a\n```\n\n### namespace\n\nCreates a new namespace/project in your cluster and copies the necessary `configMaps` and `secrets` from the `tools` namespace.\nThis enables new pipelines to be registered and run and for them to have access to all the essential data needed to access the tools and the IBM Cloud platfrom.\n\n### tools\n\nLaunches the `ibm-garage-cli-tools` docker image in an interactive\nterminal.
