After you select **Y** (for yes), \n    the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.\n\n    Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer) \n    and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes.\n\n    <InlineNotification kind=\"success\">\n\n    You should now have your Developer Tools environment\n        fully provisioned and configured. Enjoy!\n\n    </InlineNotification>\n\n\n\n### Developer Tools environment\n\nOnce the Terraform scripts have finished, you can see the resources that the scripts created in IBM Cloud:\n- In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#dashboardview \"Managing resources in the resource list\")\n- On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group (e.g. `catalyst-team`)\n- You should see these resources listed:\n    - **Clusters**: 1, either Kubernetes or OpenShift\n    - **Services**: 5 or so, such as PostgreSQL, LogDNA, etc.\n    - **Storage**: 1, an instance of Cloud Object Storage\n- Select the cluster and open the Kubernetes dashboard or OpenShift web console. You should see:\n    - Namespaces: `tools`, `dev`, `test`, and `staging`\n    - Deployments in the `tools` namespace: `catalyst-dashboard`, `jenkins`, etc.\n\nTo get started with code use the following guides:\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"../../getting-started/deploy-app\">Deploy First App</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"../../guides/overview\">Guides</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"../../guides/tools-image\">Developer Tools Image</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n### Possible issues\n\nIf you find that that the Terraform provisioning has failed, try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again. \nThe state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.\n\nIf you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, you can try this:\n- Manually delete the service instances in your resource group\n- Delete the `workspace` directory (which will remove any state that has been created by Terraform)\n- Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script\n    ```bash\n    rm -rf workspace\n    ./runTerraform.sh\n    ```\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/bwoolf/dev/git/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-developer-guide/src/pages/admin/installation-ibm-cloud/index.mdx"}}}}
